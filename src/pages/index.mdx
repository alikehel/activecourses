Active Courses University is a community targeting to work in Big N. Similar to [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), it provides educational resources & help. Additionally, ACU provides professional Career, Networking, and Academic Advisory services.

ACU community is not "yet another Stackoverflow-like" community; The real benefit you will gain is not an answer to your question, but connection with everyone who answered.

Similar to universities, services are provided mostly by peers/students, and some by professionals (> 3 YoE). ACU members are all authentic members providing Services (Tutoring, Course curation (via feedback & comparison), Career Services, Academic Advisory, and much more in [Services Onboarding](#services-onboarding)).

For a full comparison between ACU and other servers, online communities, paid boot camps and real universities, Check [ACU Comparison](/about-us/acu-comparison).

ACU Resources consist of three primary resources (OSSU, CS Fundamentals, and Big N SE Roadmaps) utilizing suggestions from Pioneer Software Engineers and other reliable sources. Unlike OSSU, ACU provides multiple options per subject tailored to each student's needs. Further information is in [Resources](#resources).

If you like the idea, share it. You will benefit directly & indirectly. Your tutor, coach, mentor, or study buddy might be the colleague you invited or invited by him. Try to share it on your Twitter, Facebook, or class group, or ask someone famous to share it.
