Active Courses University is a community targeting to work in Big N. Similar to the [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) community, it provides educational resources. Additionally, ACU provides professional Career, Networking, and Academic Advisory services.

Similar to real universities, services are provided mostly by peers/students, and some by professionals (> 3 YoE). ACU members are all authentic members providing Services (Career Services, Academic Advisory, and much more in [Services Onboarding](/community/services-onboarding/academia)).

For a full comparison between ACU and other servers, online communities, paid boot camps and real universities, Check [ACU Comparison](/about-us/acu-comparison).

ACU Resources consist of three primary resources (OSSU, CS Fundamentals, and Big N SE Roadmaps) utilizing suggestions from Pioneer Software Engineers and other reliable sources. Further information is in [Resources](/resources/essential).

If you like the idea, share it. You will benefit directly & indirectly. Your tutor, coach, mentor, or study buddy might be the colleague you invited or invited by him. Try to share it on your Twitter, Facebook, or class group, or ask someone famous to share it.
