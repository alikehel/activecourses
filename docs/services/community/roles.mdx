## <span style={{color:'#1A6D34'}}>@Students</span>

### Who are <span style={{color:'#1A6D34'}}>@Students</span>?

-   Authentic admitted people who applied using one of the authentication methods in the newcomer channel in the Discord server.

### What are their benefits?

-   Find tutors for the entire right side of the aforementioned Mind Map.
-   Ask mentors.
-   Have access to "life-after-grad" channel which provides help with ACU Services (everything on the left side of the aforementioned Mind Map) and "internships" channel.

:::warning

All the benefits are limited. For example, people asking questions in Princeton Algorithms Part 1 Week 6 will help people in Week 5, and the hierarchy goes on. The student receives a single warning if they do not offer help as they were helped. The second time, he is banned. (Reason in [Members Explanation](/services/community/general#members))

### How to be <span style={{color:'#216694'}}>@Trusted</span>?

-   Provide ideas, resources and help. Check channels where you can provide help. Ask us to create one if it is missing.
-   Find and collaborate with people with mutual interests. For example:
    -   Find people applying for internships (in [ACU-English](https://discord.com/channels/1026170883997438112/1176583002281738301) or [ACU-Arabic](https://discord.com/channels/950993900720492574/1154362703935184956)) or applying for full-time jobs life-after-grad (in [ACU-English](https://discord.com/channels/1026170883997438112/1026170885331222553) or [ACU-Arabic](https://discord.com/channels/950993900720492574/992733648690368512)).
