## Members

1. Community is built on a single principle "**Reciprocity**". "Those Who want help, give help". It is a two-way road where **beneficiaries** from services are **obligated** to support and contribute back to the community.
2. This is the reason for "why most of the services in the Mind Map are limited to <span style={{color:'#216694'}}>@Trusted</span> and above?".

## Services

-   They are interactive 1-1 help not some hanging resources on the internet.
-   People here are accountable for each & every word they provide. They do not mislead, misinform or be stubborn about with their thoughts. If one is not reliable to give an opinion, he will recite you from a reliable source and back his words with the source itself.
