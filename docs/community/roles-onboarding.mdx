</h2>

<h3>
    {' '}
    Who is <span style={{ color: '#1A6D34' }}>@Student</span>?{' '}
</h3>

-   Authentic admitted people who applied using one of the authentication methods in the *entry* channel in the Discord server.

### What are their benefits?

-   Find tutors for the entire right side of the aforementioned Mind Map.
-   Ask mentors.
-   Have access to *life-after-grad* channel which provides help with ACU Services (everything on the left side of the aforementioned Mind Map) and *internships* channel.

:::warning

All the benefits are limited. For example, people asking questions in Princeton Algorithms Part 1 Week 6 will help people in Week 5, and the hierarchy goes on. The student receives a single warning if they do not offer help as they were helped. The second time, he is banned. (Reason in [Members Explanation](#members-explanation))

<h2>
    {' '}
    <span style={{ color: '#E91E63' }}>@Alumni</span>{' '}
</h2>

-   Like <span style={{ color: '#1A6D34' }}>@Student</span> but with industry/academic experience and looking for career advancement.


<h2>
    {' '}
    <span style={{ color: '#216694' }}>@Trusted</span>{' '}
</h2>

<h3>
    {' '}
    Who are <span style={{ color: '#216694' }}>@Trusted</span>?{' '}
</h3>

-   People supporting the community. They are nominated by 2+ <span style={{color:'#216694'}}>@Trusted</span>. They are offered quite much more help as compared to <span style={{ color: '#1A6D34' }}>@Student</span>/@Alumni.

### What are their benefits?

-   Have access to the real server (entire ACU Services which is $3X$ what <span style={{ color: '#1A6D34' }}>@Student</span> has access to).
-   Have full access to exclusive resources that are only available to them.
-   Can be nominated to higher roles.


<h3>
    {' '}
    How to be <span style={{ color: '#216694' }}>@Trusted</span>?{' '}
</h3>

-   Think of being @Student as an interview. Each question or help tells <span style={{color:'#216694'}}>@Trusted</span> more about you.
-   Support the community as much as you can; Ask "How can I help the community?" or infer it.
-   Provide ideas, resources and help. Check channels where you can provide help. Ask us to create one (if it is missing).
-   Find and collaborate with people with mutual interests. For example:
    -   Find people applying for internships (in [ACU-English](https://discord.com/channels/1026170883997438112/1176583002281738301) or [ACU-Arabic](https://discord.com/channels/950993900720492574/1154362703935184956)) or applying for full-time jobs life-after-grad (in [ACU-English](https://discord.com/channels/1026170883997438112/1026170885331222553) or [ACU-Arabic](https://discord.com/channels/950993900720492574/992733648690368512)).
    -   Help people with their resumes in life-after-grad (in [ACU-English](https://discord.com/channels/1026170883997438112/1026170885331222553) or [ACU-Arabic](https://discord.com/channels/950993900720492574/992733648690368512)).

<h2>
    {' '}
    <span style={{ color: '#E91E63' }}>@Mentor</span>{' '}
</h2>

-   An expert (with 5+ years of experience) who is open to providing mentorship.

## Special Roles

-   Only explained in Discord under their category.

## Members Explanation

1. Community is built on a single principle "**Reciprocity**". "Those Who want help, give help". It is a two-way road where **beneficiaries** from services are **obligated** to support and contribute back to the community.
2. This is the reason for "why most of the services in the Mind Map are limited to <span style={{color:'#216694'}}>@Trusted</span> and above?".
