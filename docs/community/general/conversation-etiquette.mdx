1. If talking needs more than 2 replies, you **must open a thread**.
2. If you ask a question, **be responsive to answers**.
3. **Never ask the same question twice**.
4. **Never ask before doing your research & showing it**.
5. **Don't mention** people (E.g., @omar1111) or DM unless they are comfortable with it. (ESPECIALLY **<span style={{color:'#E91E63'}}>@Mentors</span>**)
6. Don't ask to ask; Ask right away.
