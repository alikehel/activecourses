1. Don't try to respond to bullying or any rude text, please mention @Moderator.

## **Hateful discussion is prohibited**, and you will be banned forever.

1. The Server has 0% tolerance against contentions like **Religious** Disputes/Curses, **Politics**, **Sexism**, and NSFW Content (Curses or Images).
2. Never do "Character assassination". Even for a person who isn't on the server.
3. You are allowed to criticize respectfully & objectively. E.g., You can claim a course to be a "Scam" (only If you have proof) but you are not allowed to curse its instructor.

## Do not give advice when you are not eligible. For example:

1. Do not tell anyone "How to become a good Software Engineer" unless you are reciting from a credible source, or you have 5+ years of experience.
2. Do not say "This resume advice is wrong" unless you have a contradicting credible source, or you are a recruiter/hiring manager (at the same companies that the person is talking about).
