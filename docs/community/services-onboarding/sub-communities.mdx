They are all carried out in SUB-COMMUNITIES.

## Sub-Communities Explanation

ACU special communities below intentionally do not include or explain what makes them special. You will be briefed about them only if you are a member.

### OS Internships (One of ACU special communities)

Special group dedicated to discussing, mutually searching and applying to Open Source Paid Internships (Mainly Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and MLH).

### New Grads (One of ACU special communities)

Special group dedicated to Jobs Search & Application by teaming with other members who are targeting the same companies.

1. They resume-review, practice, prepare, search and apply together. This makes job hunting more tailored and efficient.
2. Sometimes you can get help from older members who applied for the same companies and roles.
3. Consider a group of 10 applying to FAANG. On average, you will prepare for an interview with 5 people, who got interviewed before you, leveraging your chances!
