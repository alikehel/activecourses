## Networking Explanation

Networking is the ultimate skill in your career path by far.

You cannot reach far in your career without extensive knowledge and experience.

But the unknown unknowns (what you do not know that you do not know) and known unknowns (what you know that you do not know) is quite much greater than known knowns (what you know that you know).

So, your only way is either by learning and experiencing everything by yourself or simply by having enough connection that covers all aforementioned unknowns.

### Conclusion

Networking benefits mentioned are just an example. In fact, the examples are drops in the ocean.

Networking is not like educational paths because life itself is undetermined, so you can't actually predict the rewards or calculate its ROI.

Maybe you cannot see now the benefits from your peers or your mentee, but over time you will.

They will eventually work for big companies and gain different experiences; your mentee will eventually grow into seniors and tech leads.

By that time, your interests and goals will differ.

You might want to open a startup or a consulting company where you need to consult or hire people.

Networking has two shapes: trading and friendship.

Trading is just an immediate favor exchange, and you only get what you can give now.

Trading will not serve you when you are weak or at the beginning.

Friendship is like a loan with interest.

If you pick the right person, the _X_ you give now, especially when he cannot pay back the favor, will return _10X_ at least.

Friendship will serve you when you are weak.

Unfortunately, this is not a blog about friendship, but this is for the people who never understood friendship or failed to retain friends for years.
