We are a community of a real university (professors, alumni, students, etc.) with authentic members you can connect with for a long time.

Members are not anonymous people who you ask once and never find again.

Unlike anonymous people, members here will help you even if you didn't ask for it, as we believe that most of the time, you don't know there is a problem more than you know there is a problem.

If you do not know the problem, how will you ask? Also, what adds to the to the community's edge is the quality of answers andÂ accountability.
