## Topics Covered

#### programming concepts

-   (Type Conversion, Polymorphism: Upcasting, Downcasting, Exception Handling: except, throw, noexcept, nothrow, Compiler, Linker, Procedural Paradigm),

#### C++ concepts

-   (Standard Input & Output, References/Pointers, STL, Headers & includes),

#### basic syntax:

(Variables, Variables Types, Arithmetic Operations, if, Loops (while, for), Nesting, Access Modifiers, Non-Access Modifiers: (static, const, final), Functions & Methods),

#### basic data structures

-   (Primitives, string, Arrays (1D, 2D, kD)),

#### data structures

-   (Encapsulation Techniques: (Struct, Pairs, Tuples), STL: (Templates, queue, Priority Queues, Deque, Stack, Iterators, References, Pointers), Vectors: (1D, 2D, kD), Sets, Multisets, map),

#### functional programming

-   (Recursion),

#### OOP

-   (concepts: (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Data-Hiding, Decomposition, SOLID Principles, inheritance: (Abstract Class, Interface, Method Overriding, Method Overloading, Operator Overloading: (Unary, Subscript, Relational, Prefix, Postfix, Input, Output, Conversion, Assignment))), Class: (Constructor, Destructor, Copy Constructor, Delete Function, Initializer List), Specifiers: (final, static, friend)),

#### algorithm complexity notions

-   (Problem Reduction),

#### algorithms

-   (sorting: (Count Sorting)),

#### universal libraries

-   (File Streams, I/O Stream),

#### basic OS

-   (Memory Stucture: (Stack, Heap), Static Variables...),

#### basic computer architecture

-   (bits & bytes, 2's Compliment, Signed & Unsigned Numbers, Floating Points & Rounding Numbers, Numbers Conversion/Casting),

#### UML

-   (Class Diagram: (Association, Aggregation, Composition, Generalization, Multiplicity)),

#### SE practices

-   (MVP, CRUD Operations, MVC, Refactoring),

#### software engineering

-   (Coupling, Cohesion),

#### advanced syntax

-   (variadic, Fold Expressions, functors (High Order Function), Lambda Expressions),

#### advanced c++

-   (Move Semantics & Perfect Forwarding, Smart Pointers: (Unique Pointers, Shared Pointers, Weak Pointers), Pointer to Pointer, Void Pointer, Function Pointer)

## Course Reviews

-   ICPC Finalist. Ph.D. in Computer Vision. Senior SWE. Senior Computer Vision Engineer. Course is premium and does not provide autograder. Extremely suggested if feasible. Premium and Udemy courses do not provide autograder. Course provides very broad exposure to Software Engineering Discipline Principles and practices in relatively short time. Have medium-sized projects.
