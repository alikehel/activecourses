-   Students are free to choose whichever course they like, but some benefits are studying from the same source as others as follows:

    -   This is the servers' purpose (mentoring each other as our questions will be around the same course, and it will be easier to find an answer); Otherwise, Won't be any different from Coursera's Discussion forum which doesn't help much and takes time for your question to be answered.
    -   Collected efforts (for picking a specific course objectively) will cover blind spots that each one has, and it will be likely better than each one picking his course & wasting efforts on course comparison.

-   Temporary course maintenance Notes:
    -   Courses are still not peer reviewed; it is another student's suggestion but has not been reviewed by a college professor or senior SWE despite being the best courses in the field.
        -   This means one might overstudy or understudy a subject (e.g., study too many algorithms).
        -   Currently, the only solution is to ask a mentor or students about your specific case (where you want to work? Which minor?...).
        -   This problem is not limited to ACU; unless the community has a peer curriculum maintainer, it is guaranteed that it will have the same problem, and they did not mention it as they were unaware.
    -   A lot of courses are still not added here but are mentioned (Pinned in each channel, written in [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) or [Omar Shawky's CS-Roadmap](https://github.com/OmarShawky1/CS-Roadmap)) and will soon be merged.
    -   Resources are better represented on the [Website](https://www.activecourses.tech/).
