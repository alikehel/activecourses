-   Students are free to choose whichever course they like, but some benefits are studying from the same source as others as follows:

    -   This is the servers' purpose (mentoring each other as our questions will be around the same course, and it will be easier to find an answer); Otherwise, Won't be any different from Coursera's Discussion forum which doesn't help much and takes time for your question to be answered.
    -   Collected efforts (for picking a specific course objectively) will cover blind spots that each one has, and it will be likely better than each one picking his course & wasting efforts on course comparison.

-   Notes:
    -   Course reviews will be provided in the GitHub Issues soon.
    -   A lot of courses are still not added here but are mentioned (Pinned in each channel, written in [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) or [Omar Shawky's CS-Roadmap](https://github.com/OmarShawky1/CS-Roadmap)) and will soon be merged.
    -   Resources that will be enhanced and rewritten in our [Website](https://www.activecourses.tech/).
