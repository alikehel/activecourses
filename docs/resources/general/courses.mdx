-   Students are free to choose whichever course they like, but some benefits are studying from the same source as others as follows:

    -   This is the servers' purpose (mentoring each other as our questions will be around the same course, and it will be easier to find an answer); Otherwise, Won't be any different from Coursera's Discussion forum which doesn't help much and takes time for your question to be answered.
    -   Collected efforts (for picking a specific course objectively) will cover blind spots that each one has, and it will be likely better than each one picking his course & wasting efforts on course comparison.

-   Notes:
    -   Course reviews will be provided in the GitHub Issues soon.
    -   A lot of courses are still not added here but are mentioned (Pinned in each channel, written in [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) or [Omar Shawky's CS-Roadmap](https://github.com/OmarShawky1/CS-Roadmap)) and will soon be merged.
    -   Resources that will be enhanced and rewritten in our [Website](https://www.activecourses.tech/).

## CS-Fundamentals

Briefly, ACU provides currently only two roadmaps for computer science: (Both follow [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) courses guidelines which is IEEE CS2013 Guidelines while being free and interactive (autograder for assignments and final project/exam))

### OSSU

### CS Fundamentals

Essential knowledge for all subfields (career paths). Similar to Gen-Ed.

#### Background Info

1. Designed & backed up by:
    1. Prof. [Mostafa Saad Ibrahim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mostafasaad/)'s Videos (Arabic): Roadmap [1](https://youtu.be/JkcmNrdhjMs) & [2](https://youtu.be/b56XFMNEzAs), [Why to follow roadmap](https://youtu.be/-oORn0GOWe4).
    2. SRE [Mohamed Moshrif](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmeshref/)'s Video (Arabic):[Roadmap](https://youtu.be/RAHNZhcoi_Q) & [Old Roadmap](https://youtu.be/jZIXKlSJcrc) & [Very old Roadmap](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?ref=search&v=2050195395035796&external_log_id=c27c284f-d228-4e39-9c4d-1447de1697be&q=mohamed%20moshrif), [Why to follow roadmap](https://youtu.be/aKv3QNiB1NU), Miscellaneous Info [1](https://www.facebook.com/mmoshrif/videos/344220917562967/?__tn__=%2CO-R) & [2](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=2172114902843844).
    3. [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).
    4. Note: They say same thing. They are not alternatives.
2. Community provides courses, materials & tutoring for the roadmap in real-time in addition to group studying.

#### Courses

1. Programming Languages (PL).
2. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
3. Problem-Solving (PS).
4. Operating Systems (OS).
5. Data Bases (DB).
6. Networks.
7. Discrete Mathematics.

#### Roadmaps Comparison

-   Check [Roadmaps Comparison](/resources/roadmaps-comparison)

## Sub-Fields (To be done...)

:::tip

Sub-Fields or CS-Minor is the different career paths.

:::

1. Software Engineering.
2. Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning Engineer, Deep Vision...).
3. Quantitative Engineer.
4. Embedded Software Engineer.
5. DevOps Engineer.

## Big N SE Roadmap

1. They are reliable roadmaps and educational content provided by professionals working at those companies as a fast route to work at them.
2. Each roadmap mentions the author and his active record. Additionally, you can ask members for their opinions.
3. Unfortunately, courses do not always support the aforementioned IEEE CS2013 Guidelines.

:::tip

Although only "Coding Interview University" is mentioned, ACU will add more resources soon.
