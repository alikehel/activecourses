## Rule 1

-   The server's purpose is to imitate college-cult-like by studying a subject from same source at same time, Thus:
    -   We gain the benefits of:
        -   Mutual Mentoring as you:
            -   Can ask questions & find help fast.
            -   Share efforts/knowledge (e.g., good course) as accumulated efforts impacts all of us exponentially.
            -   Evade studying/courses mistakes as people will guide you.
        -   Maintaining commitment by studying together.
-   We must follow the educational rules :
    -   You are not obligated to study a specific course but you should learn the same topics and solve same questions.
    -   When picking a learning resource (e.g., book, online course), it must be available for all (via drive, free course...).
    -   Course MUST be interactive (via assignments, a final project).
    -   If same topic has multiple resources, create "Decision List", after objectively agreeing upon one, that contains the following:
        -   Alternatives courses list (pros & cons for each). (to track & edit them in the future).
        -   Reasons for picking.
-   Reasons for "we all study a subject from same source":
    -   This is the servers' purpose (mentoring each other as our questions will be around the same course and it will be easier to find an answer); Otherwise, Won't be any different from Coursera's Discussion forum that doesn't help much and takes time for your question to be answered.
    -   Collected efforts for (picking a specific course objectively) will cover blind-spots that each one has and it will be likely better than each one picking his own course & waste efforts on courses comparison.

## Rule 2

-   What to do when you enter the server:
    -   Check topics that you are interested in learning it in the mean time & tell people that you want to join class. (suggest the topic in ⁠server-suggestions If it is not available yet)
    -   Type your question in the relative channels only. (Learn "How to ask" before you ask; Check No. 3 in ⁠faq )
    -   Never discuss topics irrelevant to channel. (each channel has its own rules, check picture)
    -   Before you ask, Check Pinned messages in the channel, relative to your question, first & in ⁠faq.

-   Server Etiquette rules:
    -   If talking needs more than 2 replies, you must open a thread.
